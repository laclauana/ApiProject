# First API Project EVER

## This site is still under construction, its functions arent working properly yet.

This has been/is SO exciting. 8 months ago I didn't know what HTML meant or what it was for. But look at me now!, interacting with public APIs :pleading_face: :sob: it's time already for me to confess I genuinely **love** how Javascript works, or maybe it's my teacher at Ada ITW who makes me be so freaking into coding (Pardon my French:nail_care:). But anyway: here is my first project where I use protocols for allowing website´s components to interact with each other using certain commands.
During what has been an exhausting and fun journey to achieve this goal, I had the chance to get familiarized with HTTP methods or CRUD operations for RESTful APIs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. I obviously have a long (if not infinite:infinity:) way ahead of me to learn much more about them and to work on more complex levels. But I don´t wanna rush through these first steps where I get to really savor the unique experience of mastering a new skill for the first time in this vast field that is programming :nerd_face::heavy_heart_exclamation:.

## Technologies used

HTML, SASS, Javascript :fire::boom::cupid:

### Prepare to _adore_ this API project as much as I do

#### Especially if you´re Marvel fanatic
